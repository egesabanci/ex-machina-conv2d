Applying 2D convolutions with extracted frames of the sample scene 
from Ex Machina movie for creating something artistic. Input images
are 14 extracted frames from the sample scene of the `Ex-machina` movie.
After the frame extraction, random 2D Convolutions has been applied. Then, these 14 images gathered back together for creating
the final GIF.
